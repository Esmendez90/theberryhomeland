        The Global “Abaca Fiber Market”
        Growth 2023-2030 research provides insightful information on current
        trends, challenges, market risks and market constraints of key vendors.
        This report covers geographical segmentation, current demand area,
        growth rate analysis, industry revenue, and CAGR status in detail. This
        keyword market report provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of
        company profiles, investment opportunities, development strategies,
        industry size, and market share valuations across the globe. The global
        Abaca Fiber market size was valued at USD 792.46 million in 2021 and is
        expected to expand at a CAGR of 15.03% during the forecast period,
        reaching USD 1836.35 million by 2027. Abaca, also called as manila hemp,
        is extracted from the leaf sheath around the trunk of Musa textilis, a
        type of banana plant that is mostly found in the Philippines and humid
        tropics. Harvesting and cultivating abaca is a labor-intensive process
        as the pulp is removed by cutting strips and scraping stalks. Fibers
        obtained from the process are then dried and removed. Abaca fiber has
        high strength and is used in the paper industry for making mimeograph
        mats and teabags. It is also used to make handicraft such as carpets,
        furniture, clothing, and bags. Abaca fiber is used in fishing nets,
        hawsers, and shipping lines due to beneficial properties such as
        flexibility, durability, and saltwater resistance. It is classified as a
        hard fiber along with sisal, coir, and henequin. In addition, abaca
        fiber is used in gifts, toys, and housewares. Furthermore, it is used as
        an alternative to glass fiber reinforced plastics components. Various
        local textile manufacturers use 30% to 50% of abaca in the production of
        maong (denim).
